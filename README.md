## CODSOFT DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP TASK SUBMISSION

This repository contains the task submissions for the Data Science Internship conducted by CodSoft. The tasks demonstrate fundamental concepts and skills in Data Science, showcasing my learning and application throughout the internship.

### Repository Structure

* **Titanic Survival Prediction:** Using the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. 
* **Iris Flower Classification:** Using the Iris flower measurements dataset, we built a model to learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
* **Sales Prediction using Python:** We built an ML model to leverage predictions on future sales so that businesses can optimize to their fullest.

### Titanic Survival Prediction

**Description:**
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various attributes such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin. By analyzing historical data, we aim to identify patterns and correlations that influence survival rates.

**Key Benefits:**
* Understanding Survival Factors: Identifying factors that influenced survival rates on the Titanic.
* Predictive Modeling: Creating a model to predict the likelihood of survival for hypothetical passengers.
* Data-Driven Insights: Gaining insights into the disaster through data analysis.

### Iris Flower Classification

**Description:**
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying Iris flowers into their respective species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on their physical attributes. We will utilize the well-known Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for a total of 150 Iris flowers.

**Key Benefits:**
* Understanding Iris Species: Gaining insights into the characteristics that differentiate Iris species. 
* Classification Accuracy: Developing a model that can accurately predict the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements. 
* Foundation for More Complex Problems: Serving as a starting point for learning and applying machine learning techniques to more complex classification tasks.

### Sales Prediction

**Description:**
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts future sales based on historical data and relevant factors. By leveraging Python and its machine learning libraries, we aim to create a predictive tool that can assist businesses in optimizing their advertising strategies and maximizing sales potential.

**Key Benefits:**
* Optimized Advertising Spend: Identifying the most effective advertising channels and allocating budgets accordingly. 
* Improved Sales Forecasting: Accurately predicting future sales to aid in inventory management and resource allocation. 
* Data-Driven Decision Making: Providing insights into factors influencing sales, enabling informed business decisions.
